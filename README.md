# My Bucket List

This is a MEAN stack application that allows a user to create his bucket list.

What is a bucket list? It's just a list of activities someone wants to do before he/she dies. It probably originates from the 2007 movie by Rob Reiner.

With this application, any user can:
* create and manage his account
* login to application (as well as logout from it)
* create and manage his goal

### Technology
